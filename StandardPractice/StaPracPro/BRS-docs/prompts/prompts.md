# Project Prompts Log

## Prompt 1
**Date:** [Current Session]
**Prompt:** We will work on building an application today. For every front end and backend component we will create a project folder. All documents will reside in the BRS-docs folder. Throughout our session I'll ask you to plan your work ahead and create an md file for the plan. You may work only after I approve said plan. These plans will always be stored in BRS-docs/plans folder. User stories must be stored in the BRS-docs/stories folder. Architecture and Design documents must be stored in the BRS-docs/construction/design folder. All implementation code must be in src/construction. All prompts in order must be stored in the BRS-docs/prompts/prompts.md file. Confirm your understanding of this prompt. Create the necessary folders and files for storage, if they do not exist already.

**Status:** Completed - Folder structure created and prompts.md initialized

## Prompt 2
**Date:** [Current Session]
**Prompt:** I want to implement this application using all standard practices, such as common error handling, API calling, email sending setup, and SMS sending setup, as I am an application architect.
